# Overkill

Overkill is a media player compatible with skins and plugins made for Winamp.
The Overkill graphical user interface does NOT depend on [GTK+](https://www.gtk.org/),
[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) or any other [toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_toolkit).

# Skin collections

The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) is an American non-profit organization that
archieves historical internet content.

They have a collection of old skins made for Winamp.
You can find some [here](https://archive.org/details/winampskins).

# Plugins

Overkill has this fancy unecessary feature that allows plugins originally made for Winamp
to be run. Most plugins made for it are old, obsolete, broken, incomplete, or require a
proprietary license to be used.

Plugins are more difficult to find as many contain proprietary code that cannot be
distributed freely on the internet.

Additionay, plugins originally made for Winamp do not run on Linux or other operating systems
without installing and using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) as a compatibility layer.

However, Overkill will be shipping native plugins that can be freely distributed.

# Downloading

The source code for Overkill can be found on the GitHub source code
[repository](https://github.com/ativarsoft/overkill) for overkill.

# Building

This program can be built on multiple ways.

  * As a [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/) project by using the alr command;
  * as a GPR project by using AdaCore's [gprbuild](https://github.com/AdaCore/gprbuild);
  * using the [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
    
It is also possible to build the Overkill program and libraries by using a cross-compiler.
